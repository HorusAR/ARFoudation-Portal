# ARFoundation Placeable Portal


## What is this ?

This Unity project contains a mobile AR App based on *PiratesJustAR*'s tutorial YouTube series (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKIKuXdn4ZMhwJmPnYI0e7Ixv94ZFPvEP), but reworked to work with ARFoundation so it works both on iOS and Android, using the same codebase. I also added the ability to place the portal and replace it elsewhere, using a placement indicator (reused after following https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml2UakwRxjk&t=1534s by *The Unity Workbench*)

## How to install ?

__There's two ways you can install this app:__


#### 1) Clone repo and build in Unity
  You can clone this repository and build it using Unity. In order to do this, open the project in Unity, select the scene you're trying to build and configure your target device in *file -> build settings*
  
#### 2) ANDROID ONLY - Download from releases
  If you don't feel like cloning the whole repo and building it, and you have an android device, you can try out the app by downloading the apk from https://github.com/NaelAwayes/ARFoudation-Portal/releases, and installing it on your device.
